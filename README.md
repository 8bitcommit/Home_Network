##  What It Does

This script quietly inventories every device on your home network by:
- Sending ARP requests to discover active hosts
- Looking up MAC address vendors (manufacturer identification)
- Probing a list of common TCP ports (22, 80, 443, etc.)
- Logging results to a CSV file

Use it to:
- See whatâ€™s connected to your network
- Identify unknown devices
- Understand who built them â€” and what they might be doing

---

## Requirements

- `Python 3.x`
- `scapy`
- `mac-vendor-lookup`

## Install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install scapy mac-vendor-lookup
```
## Usage

Update the subnet in scan.py to match your local network, e.g.:

subnet = '192.168.1.0/24'

Then run:
```bash
sudo python3 LocalNetworkScan.py
```
Output will be saved to:

`network_inventory.csv`
